- 👋 Hi, my name is **Dimitris**.
- 👀 I’m interested in many areas of software engineering, but mainly in Data Science, Machine Learning and the broader area of A.I.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Julia and Rust, although I consider that I am still learning Python and Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning projects and further development of Julia (once I feel confident enough). 
- 📫 How to reach me? My Twitter handle is @jim_dev_20
